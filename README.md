# Surfs up Analysis Challenge 9

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to provide W. Avy with insight about weather patterns in specific locations in Oahu. The end goal for W. Avy is to open up a surf and ice cream shop that will be sustainable year-round. Thus, in order to complete this task, tools and methods such as Pandas, Python, and SQLAlchemy were utilized. Please see below for the analysis deliverables. 

- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis 


## Analysis Results

- Average Temperature is higher for the months of June in comparison to the months of December. Although the discrepancy between the two months isn't significant. Thus, meaning that the surf and ice cream shop business would receive a consistent and sustainable amount of consumers year-round. 

- Another observation between the June and December months comparison is the standard deviation of the temperature changes. The increase in temperature spread from the months of June compared to the months of December is approximately 15%. This may impact ice cream shop sales, but the impact would be minimal since the majority of the time the temperature would be within an acceptable range for most consumers. 

- The last key difference between the months of June and December would be the min and max temperatures. When comparing the max temperatures, June and December don't differ very much. However, looking at the min temperatures creates some concern. Not a whole lot of concern though since these temperatures are only in the lower quartile and the majority of time the temperature remains at acceptable levels. This is known by looking at the means for both June and December and seeing that both months are skewed towards warmer temperatures. 

## Summary 

The statistical analysis results between June and December do not differ greatly and there is not much else to say from this. There are definitely discrepancies between the two months, but ultimately nothing of concern for W. Avy and his prospective business. Nevertheless, W. Avy can still continue to do research and narrow down on the best location for the new surf and ice cream shop to maximize its potential successes by conducting the two additional queries mentioned below. 

- Query 1: Stations. This will allow for W. Avy to optimize the region selection for the new business by combining the weather data collected and station location to narrow down on prospective sites.

- Query 2: Precipitation. This is another query that will allow for W. Avy to further optimize the region selection for the new business. This query will provide insight about vegetation and other ideal parameters that W. Avy feels will contribute to the success of the business.
